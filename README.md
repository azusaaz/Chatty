## Functions
- Multiple User can do real time online chat through a page.
- Users can set or change their user name.
- Posted image urls(http:// or https:// with a file extension (.jpg, .png, or .gif) are rendered as the image. (In some cases, image url doesn't have any file extension. You can add either matching one (.jpg, .png, or .gif) manually to use the url.) (If you want to include url and text, or multiple urls, they must be split by whitespace)
